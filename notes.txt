npm run build !== npm build
only start keyword is reserved like that
using React.createElement is not friendly, so JSX was introduced
JSX is not html inside jsvascript
JSX is totally different, it has HTML-like or XML-like syntax
It is totally different syntax
React.createElement() => React Element which is an Object => on rendering => HTML Element
JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS engine -> done by Parcel using Babel
JSX => converted to react.createElement by Babel=> React Element which is an Object => on rendering => HTML Element
try to explore different attributes for JSX as compared to html
